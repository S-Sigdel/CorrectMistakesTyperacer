# CorrectMistakesTyperacer
I modified this script so that people cal correct their mistakes in the general public game without needing for the game to end completely; the past script needed everyone in the game to complete the game whereas the updated one starts right after you finish the game. The script begins when you're wither first, or second, or third and so on. Link to the original author: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/425569-correct-your-bad-habits
